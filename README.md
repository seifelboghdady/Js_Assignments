# Zero Platform Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the Zero platform.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- Each exercise is in its own folder: `exercises/exercise_[number]/`
- Solutions are in `solution.[ext]` files
- Tests (if any) are in `test_solution.[ext]`

## 📚 Exercises

### Exercise 1: [Exercise Title]
**Question:** Here’s your assignment written in **clean, professional Markdown** (only English):

````markdown
# Assignment 01

You are given the following **Constructor Function**, and the task is to convert it into **Class Syntax**.

```javascript
function Car(name, model, price) {
  this.n = name;
  this.m = model;
  this.p = price;
}
````

---

## Requirements

1. Convert the `Car` constructor into a **Class**.

2. Add **two methods** inside the class:

   * `run()` → prints `"Car Is Running Now"`.
   * `stop()` → prints `"Car Is Stopped"`.

3. Create **three cars** using this class (with any data you choose).

4. Print the data of the **first car** in the following format:

   ```
   "Car One Name Is MG And Model Is 2022 And Price Is 420000"
   ```

5. In the **next line**, print the result of calling the method `run()`.

## Expected Output

```
"Car One Name Is MG And Model Is 2022 And Price Is 420000"
"Car Is Running Now"
```

```

Do you want me to also **write the full class implementation in JavaScript** (with the 3 cars and output), or just keep it as instructions in Markdown?
