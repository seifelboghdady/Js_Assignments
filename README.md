## 📚 Exercises
# Assignment 01
You have the following Constructor Function and are required to convert it to Class Syntax.  
Do not rely on the program; do it yourself to ensure you know the Syntax.
## Requirements:
1. Add two methods:
   - One named `run`
   - One named `stop`
     
   Each method should contain a message:  
   - The first: `"Car Is Running Now"`  
   - The second: `"Car Is Stopped"`

2. Create three cars using this Class with any data you choose.
3. Print the data of the first car in the Console using the method shown below.
4. On the next line, print the method named `run`.

### Original Constructor Function:
```javascript
function Car(name, model, price) {
  this.n = name;
  this.m = model;
  this.p = price;
}
```

### Expected Output:
```
"Car One Name Is MG And Model Is 2022 And Price Is 420000"
"Car Is Running Now"
```
